# Dijkstra's algorithm
Implementation of Dijkstra's algorithm in C. This implementation allows for the user to specify edges and "holes" in an NxN matrix.

# Compilation
- `make` or `make all` will compile all C source files into an executable `dijkstra`.
- `make clean` will clean/remove all created object files and the final executable.
